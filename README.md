# Verilog-Gobang-Game-with-AI
This is my project for the course "Logic and Computer Design Fundamentals"(LCDF, course instructor: SQS) in Zhejiang University.

It is a gobang game for one or two players which can be played using the Kintex-7 FPGA Board, a VGA monitor and a PS/2 keyboard. The players can play with each other or play with AI or watch the game between two AI. A greedy strategy is used to implement the AI of the game.

If you are intrested, you can read my project report (in Chinese) for more details.
